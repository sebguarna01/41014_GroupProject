**Group Project Task 4:** "This project aims to calibrate the relative pose between camera end effector, pattern-end effector or robot base-global RGB-D sensor" Zhao, L. (2023).

The DoBot Robot Hand-Eye Calibration project is a significant endeavor in the realm of robotics, aiming to bridge the gap between perception and action by achieving precise hand-eye calibration on the DoBot Magician robot. This calibration is vital for enhancing the robot's performance in various applications, from control and object recognition to navigation. The project's scope encompasses understanding the mathematical principles of calibration techniques, integrating sensor data, and developing software solutions to achieve optimal calibration. The DoBot Robot Hand-Eye Calibration project aims to achieve precise calibration between the pattern-end effector and a mounted camera, enhancing accuracy and performance in various applications.
